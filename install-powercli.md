Started from finding [How To Install and Use PowerShell and PowerCLI
on Linux][] while looking howto set MAC via [VMware vSphere API Python
Bindings][] aka `pyvmomi` (because [vmware\_guest][] is not OK for the
task), but also used [VMware PowerCLI Blog][] when facing out of the
box installation problem.
